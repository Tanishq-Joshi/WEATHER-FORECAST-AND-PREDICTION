# WEATHER-FORECASTING
A machine learning-based weather prediction system leverages meteorological data and advanced models like RNNs and LSTMs to capture temporal patterns. Optimized using error metrics such as MAE and RMSE, it provides real-time, accurate forecasts to support agriculture, disaster management, and other sectors.


# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traditional weather forecasting methods often rely on numerical weather prediction models, which can be resource-intensive and sometimes lack precision, especially in short-term forecasts. These models require significant computational power and are limited by the complexity of atmospheric dynamics. Given the increasing availability of large datasets and advancements in machine learning (ML), there is a potential to develop more efficient and accurate forecasting methods. However, integrating historical weather data with ML techniques presents challenges in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. The key problem is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of weather forecasts by effectively leveraging historical data and modern ML techniques.

# OBJECTIVES
Specifically, the project aims to:

Collect and Preprocess Data: Gather a comprehensive dataset of historical weather information and preprocess it to ensure data quality and suitability for modeling.

Model Development: Explore and implement various machine learning algorithms like regression models, to build predictive models.

Performance Evaluation: Assess the accuracy of the developed models using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), and compare the results with traditional forecasting methods.

Feature Analysis: Investigate the impact of different features and data preprocessing techniques on the model's performance, aiming to identify the most significant factors influencing weather predictions.

Optimization and Deployment: Optimize the models for better accuracy and computational efficiency, and explore potential deployment strategies for real-time weather forecasting applications.
